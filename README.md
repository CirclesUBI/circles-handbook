Foreword:

In Search of the Money Commons:

Emergent currencies are a practical tool that allow for the democratization of resources in times of crisis. A confederation of such local community currencies, alongside the parallel relocalization of economic relations could be called a Money Commons. A money commons is a counter-movement against financialization. It is an attempt at democratizing the institutions that underpin monetary creation today—central and private banks—and transform them anew in order to democratise the economy itself. Universal Basic Income (UBI) is a civilizational paradigm shift. The transformation of money, its democratization into a people-powered-money commons, issued by people as a universal and unconditional income, is part of the key that will unleash humanity’s peaceful cohabitation with other forms of life in a sustainable way, but only if done right. 


The idea of UBI challenges us into rethinking how we value human beings. Here we understand value not merely in an economistic sense of what people produce but more anthropologically as how people give meaning to their own actions. Humans spend only a very small portion of their time in producing anything, at least in the sense of bringing new things - cloths, hardware,  buildings – into being. More time is spent in adjusting, cleaning, repairing, maintaining, rearranging or transporting things, without even taking into consideration the labor directed at caring or educating other people. Circles aims to visibilize and value these flows, which are today made invisible by capitalism’s private/public dichotomies. Circles was designed to be a different money, with different values. Hence, the value system reflects this in it’s design by allowing people to have the power to issue promises unconditionally, and decide in which sort of relationships they want to be involved in and how. In this sense, Circles is different from nation-state UBI proposals, where money would be given in national currency by the state. As people in your community embed their values in the system and start self-organizing the economy at local, regional and confederated levels, economic power will be contested locally, empowering people to decide what they want to value and how.



This handbook will show how UBI can be implemented from the bottom up in practical ways. The goal of Circles is to build the social and technical infrastructure for the distribution of value, where people decide what is important in life, giving people the unconditional power to issue promises with the people around them. If you’re reading this, you are already taking part in this change.


The following is a user's manual which aims at explaining ‘how to organise your own local economy’ using a basic income currency, Circles UBI, as a means of changing humanity’s relationship to itself - our current economic paradigm - and build the basis for a society that is more caring of each of its members and other forms of life.  The first part explains what Circles UBI is and the meaning of trust in the system. The second part goes into detail about how to organise your local economy using democratic assemblies as a form of governance, following the principles of localism, decentralization, self-sustainability and democratic confederation. The third part explains how to build an economic credit circle in your area with the local vendors, workers and communities at large.

Introduction to Circles UBI 



To understand what Circles is, we must begin by asking: 

What is Universal Basic Income (UBI)? 

According to the Basic Income Earth Network (BIEN), basic income is a periodic money payment unconditionally delivered to all on an individual basis, without means-test or work requirement. UBI has thus 5 characteristics: 

1. Periodic—It is paid at regular intervals (for example every month), not as a one-off grant.
2. Cash payment—It is paid in an appropriate medium of exchange, allowing those who receive it to decide what they spend it on. It is not, therefore, paid either in kind (such as food or services) or in vouchers dedicated to a specific use.
3. Individual—It is paid on an individual basis—and not, for instance, to households.
4. Universal—It is paid to all, without means test.
5. Unconditional—It is paid without a requirement to work or to demonstrate willingness-to-work.  (reference basicincome.org) 



While the definition does talk about UBI being a “cash payment” given in an “adequate means of exchange”, it does not tell us anything about where this money will come from, the institutions that will bring it into being or the nature of this money more generally. In this handbook, we focus on a grassroots democratic view of money: you can think of Circles as a people powered money. 


What is Circles? 


You may be asking yourself: what does UBI mean in a people powered system?


With Circles, people claim the right to a basic income by issuing money into being. Understanding money as a set of promises we make to one another, Circles gives people the equal and unconditional power to issue promises into the world and claim resources. In Circles, people exercise the power to create money, thereby democratising it’s creation.


Circles is a form of electronic money, which people have the power to issue on a periodic, individual basis, without means-test or work requirement. In order to become an unconditional basic income, to claim enough wealth and be free of wage labor, covering one's basic needs, political and economic organization is needed. People therefore take the responsibility of issuing promises to one another, without the need to repay it back to a bank or a state. The only prerequisite is access to the internet and that other people in your community trust you in order to enter the system (See section on Trust). 
In the current protocol, there is an embedded inflation rate to the Circles system. Inflation is always a process of redistribution. Under the current debt system, this redistribution happens from debtors (those who owe money) to creditors (those who lend money), creating a widening wealth inequality - from the 99% to the 1% -. In contrast, In Circles, inflation is a process or redistribution that equalizes wealth relatively between different individuals. For example, if somebody joins early and exercises her power to issue money more than those who join later, this differential amount decreases relatively over time. The share of the monetary mass will constantly increase as every person starts to claim their basic income by issuing promises to others, thereby fostering circulation. In Circles, people have the equal and constant right to issue a portion of the money supply as an unconditional income or dividend. 


The Circles system is therefore a material and symbolic infrastructure for the distribution of value. The Circles system acknowledges relationships between people as the necessary bedrock for social forms to emerge that more accurately reflect the needs of the community. For now, that universality is limited by access to an internet connected browser, and depends on infrastructure that is not sensitive to the relationships between the members of any given community.  We do not support digital colonialism. We expect that the system will become more inclusive as more people get involved and start to organize their own local economies. For now, we use the means available to us to co-create alternatives - acknowledging it’s contradictions - and contesting them in practice. 



Currencies and Trust: Mutual Currents of Credit

Today, we use one money to manage health, education, local and international trade, agriculture, and many other aspects of life.  This "one size fits all" mode of exchange is like a pine forest.  In such a forest, decaying pine needles acidify the soil and prevent certain types of plants from growing. The simplicity involved has its advantages and it might be efficient, but the thing about monocultures is that when something goes wrong, like a fire, or an invasive parasite, or a recession, it becomes a threat to all participants collectively.  


The monetary design for Circles, by contrast, resembles a jungle.  In the jungle, success requires a healthy arrangement of relationships with your neighbors.  There are no bankers dictating which strategies are permitted.  The system is open to a wider diversity of strategies.  Unlike life in a monoculture, if something goes wrong in the Jungle, the parts of the system that are unrelated to the problem either adapt to the changes or remain intact.  This means that individual failures are less likely to threaten the whole interconnectivity of the support network.  By providing this kind of resiliency, Circles aims to make it less risky to explore new ways of supporting your community.

With Circles, when a new person joins, they exercise the power to issue credit to others.  Alone, these are called personal currencies, but together these form a network of mutual currencies. As personal currencies only start to circulate once somebody else trusts them —the structure of that network depends on the ecology of trust people have with each other. Currents of trust are like different rivers finding their way from the mountain, through the jungle and to the ocean. The more trust exists in a community, the easier wealth will flow and circulate between them, creating ecologies where different social relations can thrive.



Why Trust?

You might wonder: Why is Trust needed? You need to understand what trust is if you want to use Circles properly. Trust has a dual meaning in the Circles system: one social, one technical. 
From a social perspective, it means the ability to issue credit to others. Trust flows the same way as goods and resources. Trusting somebody else's Circles means that you are willing to accept their IOUs (I owe yous) as payment in exchange for something of value. You can pay people you do not know through what we call transitive exchange. You can think about transitive exchange as the 6 degrees of separation which connect all human beings on Earth. Credit therefore ripples, flowing the opposite way of stuff. See more in the white paper.

From a technical perspective, trust means that you acknowledge somebody is a real person, that they are who they say they are. In the initial iteration of Circles, in order to enter the system you need 3 people to trust you. Trust is there to avoid people making fake accounts, pretending to be someone who they are not and claiming, unfairly, 2 basic incomes for themselves. The point of it is not to replace the trust between people with a faceless technology, but to create new social and political institutions with the infrastructure this technology provides, by trusting one another. 
The more people trust each other’s Circles as a reliable means of payment, the more Circles currencies will be positioned socially as money. From a design perspective, trust is needed to make sure that people are who they say they are without the need for creepy biometrics and surveillance capitalism dystopias. In other words, trust in the Circles system means both the ability to spend and that you believe other people are real, trustworthy peers in your community.
Ideally, the people who trust you to enter the system are already in your communities, exchanging with one another the things they need in their lives, forming what we call a Web of Trust (WoT - see more in the whitepaper), where the different currencies circulate. As Circles evolves, we expect different Webs of Trust emerging in different local areas, with their own rules about how people can join.



2 . Social and Economic Organization 

In order to start Circles in your local area, you need people and merchants willing to redeem their resources for Circles. In order to get started, you will also need other people who can help you in organising a democratic economy around you and most importantly, who trust you and who you trust.


a. Principles:

To organise the Circles economy, we follow 4 principles: 

             Self-sustainability
             Decentralization
             Localism
             Democratic Confederalism
            
            
Circles is ideally meant for local municipal constituencies which can be federated following the principles of direct democracy. Each of these principles taken alone are not enough to bring about truly liberatory and transformational change in our societies. We must therefore think holistically about these four principles. Circles aims to provide social and technical tools to build alternatives to today’s neoliberalism and corporate feudalism.  It starts with the decentralization of economic power built by local, interconnected regions that complement each other’s resources and needs in sustainable ways.  These will be confederated together at the broader regional, national and international levels from the bottom up. The democratization of money in the form of a truly liberatory basic income which represents our common wealth can only be achieved by means of economic democracy. 





b. Democratic Assemblies: 


“…the mistakes that are made by a truly revolutionary orkers’ movement are, historically speaking,immeasurably more fruitful and more valuable than the infallibility of the best possible ‘Central Committee’.”
Rosa Luxemburg, critiquing the Russian revolution



The following outlines a practical governance structure which the Circles communities: seasonal democratic assemblies. 

This system of local neighborhood, municipal and local seasonal assemblies allows for people to come together and decide on the organisation of their own local economic circle. This means embedding the real economy by using Circles, by bringing different sectors of the economy together, and creating a local, interconnected system of value where different things can flow. 



What is an assembly?



The assemblies are the self-administration structures formed by individuals.  An assembly is a local democratic system of governance where people from the community (village, neighborhood, city, canton, etc.) get together to discuss and decide over the different aspects that affect their lives. 



Why are we choosing it to start experimenting with governance structures for Circles? 



Because Circles aims to create a system that provides people a basic income to live, an assembly creates a democratic structure to come together and decide over how to get there. The assembly serves as the space whereby people can choose over what they need in the network, take direct actions to make it happen and maintain the system. The goal is the formation of local assemblies with members from diverse cultures who belong to different social classes, yet are working together with a common goal. The democratic principles of the assemblies are as follow: 


            Discussions, decision making and the implementation of decisions regarding the democratic organization of the economy should be carried out with the people who use Circles.
            Equal representation (gender, youth, elderly, minorities etc.) must be implemented.
            Co-spokespersons by the coordination group should be implemented in all economic councils (see coordination group).
            Why periodic assemblies? 
            
            

Having assemblies allows people to plan for change and adapt accordingly to the fluctuations of the year and the emergent needs of each cycle. Assemblies are to be organised at least on a monthly basis to explore changes that need to be made, onboard (trust) new people, resolve any problems and conflicts and decide on the goals, tasks and responsibilities. For example, the Berlin assembly is the first Wednesday of every month. They could be seasonally structured into 3-4 month periods (Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn) or 6 month periods (Dry and Rainy) or however seasons are rooted in each region. The periodicity not only allows us to keep a steady pace, it provides us with an openness to change and experimentation. People’s needs change throughout the year, so the seasonal assemblies help to portray that. 



i. Coordination Group:



In order to decentralize power both within and outside the assemblies, it is important to have a coordination group which cares for the democratic organisation of the local economy with Circles. The coordination group is in charge of: 


            Organising the assembly
            Taking protocol of the decisions taken and making sure the decisions produced in the assembly are carried out
            Administration of the different elements that arise 
            Having an overview of the different working groups and their interconnectedness. 
            Support the needs of the working groups
            Speaking on behalf of the assembly when needed
            Represent the local assembly at the regional, confederated assemblies.
            The coordination group can be made up of 3 to 5 people depending on the size of the assembly, which should rotate after a specific period of time. The             coordination time is decided upon by the local assembly (can be 3 months to 4 year terms, this depends on the group and its needs).



Economic Councils: 



The aim of the Circles currency is to become a community basic income where people can attain a basic livelihood from it. What this means and how it is achieved depends on each community. The seasonal economic councils are meant to organise different elements of what makes up the economy, or household, around you - so that you can get the things that you need in Circles. They are to be decided upon in the assembly based on the needs in the region. The economic councils are the ones in charge of talking to different sectors of the economy (or household) in order to onboard them in the system and coordinating between each other.  These sectors may include: merchants, shops, cooperatives, businesses, communities, urban gardens, farmers, care, cleaning, manufacturers, retailers, restaurants, wholesalers, housing, construction.  Below are some examples:



Food Organisation Group: 

Within the assembly, one of the groups that might emerge is one that organises food in the region. Depending on each bioregion, the group will have to talk to local food producers, depending on the needs and what can be sourced locally. Everyone wants food in their own local currency. What is important is that those who provide the food (e.g. farmers, fishermen, etc) have a place to spend circles that is useful for their own needs. So if you onboard the cereal farmer who produces flour, it is important the food group can connect them to someone else who can fulfill one of their needs. So, for example, if the mill is outside the cereal farm, they could accept circles from the farm as part of their service fee. Alternatively, the cereal farmer could use the circles they receive to pay for labor or buy goods from other farms. You have to think in (interconnected) circles!



Ecologistics - Distribution Group

One of the things you will discover when organising a local economy is the role distribution or logistics plays in bringing stuff from point A to point B. Today, most of these channels are a monopoly. Most people have never thought about the process of where the things they buy come from. From food delivery to letters to regional transportation of heavy equipment and food, “logistics” is today largely organised by medium sized and big international corporations, which control the flow of goods and add to their cost to the end consumer. To organise Circles, one way to get a lot of local merchants and producers to join is to organise local and regional distribution groups which accept Circles for payment. This lowers costs for them and creates a more intimate relationship between buyers and sellers. Local community distribution of goods is more ecological. In Berlin, one of the self-organised distribution platforms we came to know called itself Ecologistics, to embody the values of a sustainable economy.


Caring Circles

You make a cup once, but you wash it a thousand times. In order to democratise the economy, it is important to visibilize and change how we value the reproductive work which today sustains the rest of the economy. A care group can get together to organise circles of care - people who consciously provide care work for others in need. Whether that is babysitting, therapy, elderly-care or simply doing maintenance or repairing work for others, those who provide care work can accept circles and spend them again in circular ways.


Housing Group: 

The housing group can engage the everyday citizen into joining Circles and organise together for a more fair housing situation, that takes into consideration the real needs and capacities of people. A housing group within Circles is responsible for talking to landlords and house-owners, to get them to accept Circles for part of their rent. This is a practical way where landlords can support the community at large, by giving their houses and apartments for cheaper in national currency terms, by also accepting Circles. Land owners could also accept Circles for the buying of land. Together with the coordination group, the housing group can engage the municipality, to tell them the benefits of accepting Circles as taxes. This would allow Circles to circulate more widely. Landlords who accept Circles can spend them at local shops or pay local service providers, like energy providers or even as taxes to the local municipal government. 


Computer Programming Group: If there are people in your area who have computer programming experience, they may be able to help in building localized, situated software for the Circles system, even creating their own clients and instances of the protocol. They can also provide support in other tasks like administration, logistics and so on. Having someone knowledgeable of computer science in your local network will help you organise and in democratizing the technical knowledge of the Circles system.




c. Self- Sustainability:

The term economy originally comes from the ancient greek word “oikos” which means household and “nomos” which in greek philosophy meant something like the agreed conventions, norms or ways in which society is organised and chooses its laws by way of reasoning and consensus. Economy or Oikonomia thus meant the way in which the household is organised - or “the order of the household”. Actual households in ancient Greece likely fell short of the democratic ideal that Circles strives for, specifically regarding how slaves and women were treated.  Bearing that difference in mind, let’s envision a household that we would want to live in.  In this section we’ll explore how Circles can make our economies more like that one.  

In order to organise Circles, we would like to pose a different understanding of household as one which does not divide between what is known today as the private and the public spheres of life, towards a more communal understanding of household, a planetary household which we all inhabit and are part of in all of our local and situated experiences and territories. In this sense, to create a self-sustainable household, we must first start locally, observing and interacting with our environment. Understanding our context is part organising sustainable households. Just as we never enter the same river twice, every social ecological region of the world is distinct from others, with their own histories and practices. 

The Circles system is designed with the idea of differentiation and interdependence. No person is an island. While local democratic autonomy is important, it can only be strengthened and expanded through its interdependence with other regions. The current globalised Household works in a deterritorialized way, whereby flour is grown in Canada, shipped to China to mass produce bread loafs and transported to Germany for the final baking process, marketed as “freshly baked bread”. This is a very wasteful household. Circles can be used as a tool for local communities to empower each other economically.  By spending it on the things that are made and maintained in their regions, people can take an active and democratic role in organizing the systems that they rely on. Particularly, communities can use Circles to realign the flow of goods so that it matches their currents of trust. This means relying less on a global hodgepodge of uncaring corporations, and more on an awareness of who we trust (and who trusts us) to ensure that necessary goods make it through to our household.


d. Decentralization:


If one is talking about political power, decentralization alone is not enough to bring about truly transformative change in society. Writing in the 90s, social ecologist Murray Bookchin, noted that:


            “It is a troubling fact that neither decentralization nor self-sufficiency in itself is necessarily  democratic. Plato’s ideal city in the Republic was indeed designed to be self-sufficient, but its self-sufficiency was meant to maintain a warrior as well as a philosophical elite. Similarly, decentralization in itself provides no assurance that we will have an ecological society. A decentralized society can easily co-exist with extremely rigid hierarchies. A striking example is European and Oriental feudalism, a social order in which princely, ducal, and baronial hierarchies were based on highly decentralized communities.”
            
            
            
A parallel can be drawn with the world of decentralized peer-to-peer technologies. We understand technology not just as the ensemble of raw materials, tools, machines, and related devices that are needed to produce a usable object. For us, the Circles techné serves the situated social, ethical and political  purpose of making an unconditional basic income come into being in a truly democratic manner. Today’s decentralization movement promises the appropriate technologies to create decentralised infrastructures in domains like information, money and even administration. Despite its potentialities, the political economy and design of technologies such as blockchain suffer from a naive understanding of power, reproducing feudal-like structures unto the virtual realm - with the means of production controlled by emergent elites who either hold the knowledge or the capital to influence such systems. These create hidden hierarchies and potential autocracies with a single point of failure.


Then there’s the question of the meaning of decentralization itself. It often appears that today’s techno-optimists use decentralization to mean a change from a centralized system (central banks, nation-states) to one where no-one can influence the system, through the usage of complex computational algorithms and other forms of magic. This giving of responsibility to the machine is often argued in terms of transparency. Machines don’t lie, people do. We will call this very political attempt at the automation of politics, the logic of trying to solve political problems with technical solutions, the anti-politics machine. 

Intentions and ideologies are hidden within the algorithms of this anti-politics machine, which in reality reflects the political and economic arrangements by which technologies such as blockchains operate. The different mathematical “proofs” are just ways of arranging power. Because we are trying to build a truly democratic monetary system, the infrastructure upon which it lives must reflect these values. Otherwise we will only be changing one master for another one.
By decentralization we mean something very specific: the decentralization of political and economic power via democratic and autonomous practices. The decentralization of the production of money, claimed by people directly as a universal income through infrastructures like Circles, forms the basis of a democratic economy. Yet to truly get there, the technological infrastructure must also be democratised. To build a decentralized, international money commons infrastructure we must go beyond the tyranny of the anti-politics machine, to a system where each person has an equal say over their own money system. 



e. Local Solutions for Global Problems: Democratic Autonomy


The ethos of localism is to think global and act local, or to think about local solutions to global problems, situating yourself where you are, by interacting with your environment and seeing what are the resources and needs in your area. Localism is therefore a call for autonomy and local democracy or democratic autonomy, for short, as a principle for the organisation of society. 

Democratic autonomy is a way by which each group can organise according to their abilities and needs and build together a different economic paradigm, based on a different value system than that of capitalism and the nation-state: one that nurtures the commons and democratic forms of arranging life. 

All units within the confederal structure organise themselves autonomously. These structures can be people’s assemblies, cooperatives or academies. The fundamental unit of these structures is the circles of trust people organise within. Within this context, the fundamental institutions in implementing  direct democracy are the democratic assemblies (see above). In the aim of solving society’s economic problems and providing for society’s needs, the cooperative structures are imperative. Democratic Autonomous Organizations (DAO) of Circles should organise their own assemblies and then connect to others in broader regional confederated levels, as per need. 


f. What is Democratic Confederalism?

Democratic Confederalism starts from the notion that every entity has the right to organise itself from the local to the universal. It is an ethical, political, and administrative expression of society in which different identities, factions and groups coexist in harmony with one another. By this we are not referring to a classical confederal structure consisting of states, but the confederal unity of different social structures. The fundamental difference between the two is that one relies on the state and the other on society. 

Democratic Confederalism is a consciously wholistically formed body of interdependencies that unites participatory democracy in municipalities with a scrupulously supervised system of coordination. Democratic confederalism has the potential to transcend the negativities that arise from the nation-state system. It is simple and easily applicable. Using democratic confederalism as a model, every community, ethnicity, culture, religious group, intellectual movement and economic circle can autonomously organise itself and express itself as a political entity.

In this sense, every entity or federative unit has the right to apply direct democracy to its structure. This is where all its power derives from. The confederation works in a way whereby members of each coordination group meet in a wider regional, national and eventually an international assembly to discuss and bring the decisions made at the local levels, help each other, and find solutions to common problems. 

From local to planetary and back:

      The Berlin assembly is made up of people representing different neighborhoods in the city (Neukolln, Krezberg, Marzhan, Lichtenberg, etc). The Berlin assembly can be in turn a federation of smaller neighborhood wide assemblies, depending on need. 

      The Berlin assembly sends two representatives from the coordination group to one of the German regional assemblies. Berlin federates together with its neighbors: the Brandenburg assembly, the Wendland assembly and the Hamburg Assembly. Other regions do the same, according to how their bioregions and how they trade with each other. 

      Each German regional assembly chooses two people of the different coordination groups to be part of the broader European or inter-regional assembly, where members from different parts of what is now Germany, Poland, Denmark and other neighboring countries meet to take the decisions made by the regional assemblies and discuss how to coordinate between them. 

      At the international level, the different inter-regional assemblies again choose a coordination group which meets with other coordination groups representing the different parts of the international planetary democratic confederation. 

      Even at the international level, power remains within the local constituencies. The broader levels serve as a means of enacting the decisions made by people in the different local democratic autonomous organisations (DAO). The coordination group is therefore representing the voices of the autonomous groups it was elected to coordinate at each level. Any individual could at any time be elected to represent the local, regional, international and planetary level. After sometime, the coordination groups rotate to make sure power circulates and is not hoarded by one specific group. 

For an existing example of such a Confederalist structure, see the Rojava Revolution. For historical examples, see the Iroquois Confederation. 





3. Values in Motion: Credit Circles 

For easier adoption in different local areas, we propose the creation of Credit Circles  as a methodology for different merchants, workers and communities at large to connect with each other, allowing the value system to emerge.  The aim of building a Credit Circle is to facilitate trade between economic entities working in any given region. 

Below is a sketch of how to build a Circle in three different steps, to facilitate the uptake of Circles. By no means it’s supposed to be a substitute for your own experience. It is merely a guide that you can use, adapt and build upon and add to. Like this, we can grow the experiences of creating democratic autonomous economies in your own organizing practice. As Circles evolves, we want to add your experiences to this handbook in order to enrich the journey of others!


The process of building credit circles works in 3 steps:



a. First part of the Circle: Merchant Network 

The first step is to onboard the local small and medium merchants in your area unto the system. Getting them a wallet is easy, keeping them engaged is the hard part! 

To be successful, you have to first map out and connect the local businesses, cooperatives and all producers of stuff you can think of in your area. It might seem a bit of a chicken or egg problem at first. Do you onboard the farmer first or the supermarket first? Do you onboard the retailer or the restaurant first? Both need each other in some way. The answer is to do both! With the assemblies, you can discuss together these questions and come up with strategies and working groups to onboard them.

The first thing you have to decide in your local area is to establish a ratio between the amount of stuff merchants are committing to sell for Circles per month or per year and what merchants will be able to spend or buy. For now, we will call this the Circles Credit Line. 

The amount that businesses such as the bakery commit should be % of their total turnover per year.  On average, the Circles credit line that a business chooses should be about 2% of its turnover, whereas the volume of Circles the business commits to accepting in one year, should be approximately 10% of their turnover, or a ⅕ ratio. 

These amounts can change (⅓ ratio , ⅙ ratio) but it’s important that there are always more goods committed than the Circles credit line. Think about it as the back-up of resources which keeps the balance of trade sustainable and the circles stable. The more people trade, the less collateral is needed as there is more trust in the system. 

Let’s start with a baker:



Say the baker has a total yearly turnover of 50,000 € worth of sales. 
You get the local baker to commit 10% of his total turnover = 5000 € worth of goods to be sold for the year in Circles.
You then collectively decide on his circles credit line, which will be 2% of his turn over last year, or 1000CRCs to spend within the network.
 His ratio is therefore  5 selling to 1 buying. (5/1 ratio), assuming a 1:1 Circles to Euro exchange.

Merchants such as the baker who join the network will commit their future sales in Circles for one reason: to guarantee future value and fungibility to their currency. Fungibility basically means ability to spend their Circles. Future value means the sales that the baker is expected to make in the future. 

What does this mean?  

Businesses are often not used to doing this and require some explanation and education before joining by the local organisers. You have to explain to businesses and merchants that the peoples’ currency is backed by their future sales (in our case, bread). This means that for Circles to work smoothly in your area, you want to make sure that there are more future commitments to selling products and services than money spent in the market. In other words, there will be more bread and other stuff available worth of Circles in the future than what the baker is currently spending in Circles.

In practice, even if the baker committed to sell 5000 euros worth of bread for a year, it does not mean they are guaranteed to sell that. They have to be active and nice to their customers if they want to sell that much.  Facilitators and organisers have to tell businesses to be aware of what they are promising to sell for Circles, to make sure they don’t lose. It is a potential to sell, not that they will actually sell this. To start, this amount should be the surplus that the baker normally wouldn’t sell, the bread that goes to waste because nobody buys.

The key, however, to making their money circle around first lies in what they buy, not what they sell. Spending is the pump that makes the circles gain velocity. When organising Circles, organisers should suggest “why dont you buy first?”  to businesses such as our baker. Basically, our baker should be encouraged to spend Circles at other vendors or partners in the network first, both to gain trust in how the system works and to see for themselves the benefits it brings. For example, the person who onboarded the baker and does marketing for them could be the first person paid by the business in Circles. To spin the circles, the baker has to spend them into being! Imagine you already built an initial small network to start circulating the currency. In our example, the baker should learn that they can buy flour, butter, milk and marketing for 1000 circles, maxing out their credit limit. Their balance between buying and selling would look something like this:



Month 1:


Buy (Initial Balance of 1000)
Sell (Bread committed: 5000)
-1000 (Circles spent)


Total Balance: 0 (maxed out their credit line)
Total Balance: 5000 CRC worth of Bread committed

When the baker sees customers coming back who want to pay in Circles, they can accept 50/50 co-payment (see below) in both Circles and the national currency. Extra sales usually means extra customers.  In this way, the Circles credits they spent for marketing in the local community came back to them in the form of more sales. The point is to make their money come back to them (that’s why it’s circles!). In this way, by incentivising merchants to spend their circles first, they can be engaged, earning back Circles credits by selling their products and also earning in the national currency, in this case the €.

As new customers come, the baker sells bread for 500 circles PLUS an extra 500€ sales:



Month 2:


Buy 
(Balance + 500)
Sell 
(Sales of 500 in circles + 500€)


-1000 (Circles Spent)




+500 CRCs


+500 €
Total Balance: +500 CRCS (credit line becomes positive)
Total Balance: 
4500 CRCs worth of bread committed remaining. 
Extra Revenue: 500 €

Their credit line goes from 0 to + 500 Circles. Their revenues in national currency goes up as well to +500 €. This shows the baker the power of solidarity: that the 1000 Circles Credit Line they had were without any interest and was generated by their peers in the network, who accepted CRCs from them and now it comes back to them in the form of more sales and extra revenue.

Due to its previous sale on month 2, the bakers Circles Credit Line went from 0 back up to 500. This means the baker can again spend another 500 in raw materials, which they do because it lowers their € cost. In the third month, the baker sold 1000 goods worth of CRCS and an additional sales of 1000€. The full circle looks like this:


Month 3:


Buy (Current Balance: 500)
Sell (Committed Goods: 4500)
-500 (CRCs spent in Raw Materials)




+1000 bread sales in CRC 


+1000 € sales
Total Balance: +1000 (maxed out CRC credit line)
Total Balance: 3500 CRC worth of bread committed 
Extra revenue: 1500€ (500€ + 1000€)

What is happening here? 


What makes the Circles spin is that the baker sees the benefits of first giving circles credits to others: their money comes back to them in the form of more sales, credits which can be again used in buying the flour and butter they need for making bread, and also in marketing and spreading the word about their freshly baked products. 
Spending therefore works like a pump or an initial lighting bolt which powers CRCs to spin within the community. 
In practice this means more revenue for them (in both CRCs and €) and lower net costs, as they can now pay in CRCs for part of the stuff any merchant needs. 
By tapping into the baker’s underutilized resources aka the bread he would have otherwise not sold (10% of his turnover), he increases his sales, which increases his revenue in €, lowering his total costs by using Circles to buy the things he needs in the merchant network!

It might be awkward at first to ask a local shop about their turnover in sales. As a group organising Circles,  you can start forms of play, bounties and games within your community and give people rewards in Circles for onboarding new businesses into the network, relocalizing supply chains and spreading the word about them, so others can go and spend there. For example, people and businesses can be incentivized by getting paid in Circles for every business they onboard unto the system. 


b. Second part of the Circle: Workers Network



The second part of the circle addresses the workers who are employed at these businesses or cooperatives.  Employers can give benefits, wages and bonuses in Circles to their workers. Workers can also buy goods and services from within the merchant network. Similarly to the merchants, workers can also decide how much of their labor time they wish to add to the system and accept as payment for their work.

You can also, for example, bring in landlords and owners of land into the system through the different economic councils, to accept Circles either for rent or even for the buying of land. Following the example of the baker above, somebody employed by the bakery could get paid in Circles and use those Circles to pay part of her rent or to buy food for her dog.Workers, when organised, are very good at demanding things from their employers and landlords! 

Additionally, the second part of the commercial credit circle opens to the third sector (NGOs, non-for profit organizations, churches, etc) rooted in the region, which widens the scope of activities offered within the network, creating and reinforcing long lasting relationships and trust in the wider community. 



c. Third Part of the Circle: Community Network



The third part of the circle involves bringing in the communities who the local businesses serve, providing a customer base capable of anchoring more wealth to the region, generating an exponential increase in the total number of exchanges. In this way, Circles becomes a daily tool which encompasses all aspects of everyday life, making a community basic income work for everybody. 

What can the community do? For things to start rotating, you have to organize an alliance between the people in the community and the businesses long term. For example, a person who onboards a business might say:

“I dont have money but I have time and a lot of friends on social media. I can tell people in my circles to come to this bakery” Social media marketing and word of mouth is a way where a person can support a business and get paid for it in Circles! If the baker is paying somebody to do some word of mouth and people start coming - small bounties - there you see on the merchant head that this network is useful in keeping me alive. With Circles you can meet your unused resources with peoples’ unmet needs. In practice the 3 parts of the circle can be organised simultaneously. We emphasize local producers and merchants in order to have a higher flow of goods which is useful for others in the network. 



d. Pricing and Payment Guidelines



Circles aims at becoming a means of payment and/or a means of exchange so people can freely decide how much they want to charge for the fruits of their work. But remember: the value of money comes from its social life, or its flow within a territory. 

There are countless creative ways in which Circles can be used. Below we outline a few pricing and payment examples that might help you in deciding how to spend your Circles. Note that this list is not exhaustive but merely a guideline which will expand as new experiences emerge.

The Mirror: If you do not know how much to charge people for something in Circles, one option is to see what the price of your product is currently in say, € or Pesos and mirror that price in Circles. Copying the unit of account (USD, Euro, etc) is an easy framework for people to know what to charge. In the initial iteration of Circles, there is a daily issuance of 8CRCs. Because fiat currencies have different inflations levels, we expect that in the future people will either create their own parameters to fit their local area or have some sort of exchange rate between CRCs and their national currency.
Co-payment: You want to buy a beer at your favorite bar. The owner of the bar is your friend and nice enough to accept Circles, as long as you also co-pay with fiat money as well (Euro, USD, etc). So, for example, if your locally brewed beer of choice is 3€, you could add an extra 3 CRCs and make your payment using both monies. Alternatively, the bar owner could ask you to pay the cost of the beer in fiat money (e.g. 1.5€) and the rest in Circles (1.5CRCs). Whatever the bargain is, co-paying in two currencies allows people to have more disposable income (whether in fiat money or in circles), which they can then use to buy supplies or whatever else they wish (see the Merchant Network). Another way to co-pay is to get businesses to accept Circles after a threshold payment in fiat money. For example, when people buy more than 5 USD worth of bread, they can also pay in Circles. 
Donation or Spende: You want to go to the community kitchen near your neighborhood to have some warm soup and meet with your friends for the afternoon party. Usually, the organizers of the community kitchen set a range of recommended prices so people have an idea of how much to pay. Spende refers to the practice of paying what you can for the food and events you attend, without a fixed enforced price. This is a very nice community practice as it allows people with different economic means to participate and pay what they can without shame. If you don’t have the means to pay with € and the community kitchen trusts you, you could use Circles for spende. The community accepts it because they trust you and know that they can use the CRCs you gave them to later buy food or other stuff they needed to make the event happen. Alternatively, you could also mix payment methods and co-pay your spende in both € and Circles.
Gifts and Counter-gifts: We give gifts all the time. Gifts help us in supporting our social life, whatever that may be, without the need for the assumption of the maximizing individual. For example, you can spend your Circles on buying a gift for a friend. She can later reciprocate with a counter-gift, buying something for Circles in the network and giving it to you as a birthday gift.
Unproductive Expenditure: Life is not a utilitarian process. People often produce more energy expenditure in their lives than what they need for their subsistence. The surplus is either taken by others in the form of exploitation or used by people in things that go beyond the world of work: laughter, love, tears, mourning the dead, art, taking care of stuff. Because we aim at creating a basic income from the bottom-up, we believe it's important to create a general economy that takes practices that are not seen by capitalism into account and give them value. Whether you want to support the work of an artist, help the ones you love or simply sacrifice your tokens of value for any social ritual, Circles can be used for expenditure without the need of “being productive”.  
Reproductive Labor: The production of stuff cannot exist without the social reproduction needed to make it happen. Taking care of ourselves, of other people, plants and animals is actually where the economy (understood as household or oikos) begins. But today, our systems of production do not account for these practices and are subsidized by the reproductive work done by many without remuneration (majoritarily women). Circles aims to facilitate a different money for a different economy with different values, one which redistributes and delegates the work needed to take care of each other and the planet. 
Say you are leaving town and need somebody to take care of your plants and pets. You ask your good friend for help and use Circles as a token of care for payment. Your friend can then use the tokens you gave him and go to the local shop to buy food.  Or, perhaps, your partner and you want to have a night out and need somebody to babysit your child. You can, for example, ask your very trustworthy babysitter and co-pay her in both your national currency and Circles, money which she can then use to pay for a workshop in social work, to pay the rent or anything else she might need. The point is to organize caring circles where these values can live, by spending CRCs in the things you want to see in society.
