It is an attempt at democratizing the institutions that underpin monetary creation today\u2014central and private banks\u2014and transform them anew in order to democratise the economy itself. Universal Basic Income (UBI) is a civilizational paradigm shift.

Here we understand value not merely in an economistic sense of what people produce but more anthropologically as how people give meaning to their own actions. Humans spend only a very small portion of their time in producing anything, at least in the sense of bringing new things - cloths, hardware,  buildings \u2013 into being. More time is spent in adjusting, cleaning, repairing, maintaining, rearranging or transporting things, without even taking into consideration the labor directed at caring or educating other people. Circles aims to visibilize and value these flows, which are today made invisible by capitalism\u2019s private/public dichotomies. Circles was designed to be a different money, with different values. Hence, the value system reflects this in it\u2019s design by allowing people to have the power to issue promises unconditionally, and decide in which sort of relationships they want to be involved in and how. In this sense, Circles is different from nation-state UBI proposals, where money would be given in national currency by the state. As people in your community embed their values in the system and start self-organizing the economy at local, regional and confederated levels, economic power will be contested locally, empowering people to decide what they want to value and how."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"This handbook will show how UBI can be implemented from the bottom up in practical ways.

The first part explains what Circles UBI is and the meaning of trust in the system. The second part goes into detail about how to organise your local economy using democratic assemblies as a form of governance, following the principles of localism, decentralization, self-sustainability and democratic confederation. The third part explains how to build an economic credit circle in your area with the local vendors, workers and communities at large.
